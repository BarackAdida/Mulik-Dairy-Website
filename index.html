                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    Mulik Dairy Solutions and Kanjiru Dairy Limited were founded with a single
                    goal in mind: to improve the livelihoods of smallholder dairy farmers in Kenya.
                    We understood the challenges that farmers face—limited access to resources,
                    lack of financing, and low-quality inputs—and we set out to change that.
                    Our journey began with a simple yet impactful idea: support farmers not
                    just by buying their milk but by providing them with the tools, knowledge,
                    and resources they need to succeed.
                    Since our inception, we’ve worked tirelessly to develop a comprehensive approach
                    to dairy farming that blends the best of traditional practices with modern
                    innovations. Through our dedication to excellence, we’ve built strong
                    partnerships, engaged in community-building efforts, and helped farmers
                    produce better yields, healthier cows, and stronger businesses

                        Dairy Aggregation

                    <p>
                        We collect high-quality milk from smallholder farmers daily and supply
                        it to larger processing companies such as Brookside. Through our robust
                        milk aggregation system, we ensure that farmers are paid on time, every time,
                        giving them peace of mind and a consistent income stream.

                    <li class="sevice-li">Input Financing</li>
                    <p>
                        Through our unique input financing model, Mulik Dairy Solutions provides farmers
                        with the feeds and supplies they need to care for their cows, delivered on credit.
                        This enables farmers to access critical resources without the burden of upfront costs,
                        allowing them to focus on growing their business and improving productivity.

                    <p>
                        We understand that the health of livestock is crucial to a farm’s success. That’s
                        why we provide veterinary services to ensure cows are well taken care of, preventing
                        disease and maximizing milk production

                    <li class="service-li">Training and Education</li>
                    <p>
                        To help farmers improve their practices, we offer training and educational resources on
                        topics like milk quality, herd management, and sustainable farming techniques.
                        Our goal is to equip farmers with the knowledge they need to grow their businesses
                        and improve productivity.
